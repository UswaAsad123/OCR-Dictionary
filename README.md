# OCR-Dictionary
Description:
TextExtractor is a powerful tool that leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images, process it into unigrams, and retrieve their meanings using a dictionary API. This project aims to facilitate the understanding of written content by providing definitions for individual words, making it an invaluable resource for language learners, educators, and anyone looking to enhance their vocabulary.

Features:

Image Text Extraction: Utilizes Tesseract OCR to accurately extract text from various image formats.
Unigram Processing: Breaks down extracted text into unigrams, allowing for a granular analysis of each word.
Dictionary Integration: Fetches meanings of the extracted unigrams using a dictionary API, providing definitions directly related to the context.

Technologies Used:
Tesseract OCR: For optical character recognition.
Python Open-cv: As the primary programming language.
Dictionary API: To retrieve word meanings.

Usage:
Upload an image containing text.
The application processes the image to extract text using OCR.
Each word is converted into unigrams.
Meanings of the unigrams are fetched from the dictionary API and displayed to the user.
